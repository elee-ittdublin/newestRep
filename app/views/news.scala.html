        <h3>Microsoft announces more backwards compatible Games for Xbox ONE</h3>
        <img class="img" src="@routes.Assets.versioned("/images/xbox.jpg")" alt="xbox Logo">
        <P>In the news this week, Microsoft had announced that they had more backwards compatible plans for their 
            console and that they would be revealing them on their "Inside Xbox" live stream. 
            In our opinion, they did not disappoint with great classic titles being announced.
            Titles include:
        </p>
        <h4>Destroy All Humans</h4>
        <p>
            Destroy All Humans puts you in the shoes of an extraterrestrial Alien tasked 
            with causing all sorts of Havoc on Planet Earth. With its open world, free roam environment, it wouldn't be considered a chore
            to pick up this classic again
        </p>
        <h4>Conker: Live and Reloaded:</h4>
        <p>This classic platformer, which is a remastered version of the Nintendo 64 title tells the story of Conker. 
            An orange squirrel that only wants to get back to his home after a bad night out.
            Don't Let this game's "cutsey" style throw you off though, it was given an "M" rating for a reason!
        </p>
        <h4>Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</h4>
        <p>
            A title that is debatedly Bethesda's breakthrough game in the Open world
            RPG Genre with a medieval mythical setting. It contains character customisation
            to immerse the player in a world of knights, magic and demons.
            Not to mention that this game led the developers to more critically acclaimed
            games, spanning two sequels and the highly praised Fallout Francise! 
        </p>

        <h4> Epic Games introduces "Controversial" new item for Fortnite Battle Royale</h4>
        <img class="img" src="@routes.Assets.versioned("fortnite.jpg")" alt="fortnite thumbnail">
        <p>An update for Fortnite: Battle Royale has finally rolled out which contains a new throwable item named
                <strong>"port-a-fort"</strong>. This lets the player instantly build a fort to protect themselves from enemy fire
                which, in a pinch, can prove useful but could diminish overall skill from the game.
        </p>
